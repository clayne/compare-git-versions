This directory holds Perl programs which played the role of "direct programs"
run by git-compare-versions.  These particular programs were among those I
used when doing refactoring of List-Compare functions in early 2015.

Treat them as sample programs only since, among other things, the paths in
these programs will not work on your machines.  The main thing to get out of
these sample programs is the presence of calls to both Test::More functions
and Benchmark programs within the same Perl program.
